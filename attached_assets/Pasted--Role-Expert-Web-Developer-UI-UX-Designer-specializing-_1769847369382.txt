​Role: Expert Web Developer & UI/UX Designer specializing in Modern Landing Pages (Next.js/React + Tailwind CSS).
​Context:
I currently have a website hosted at https://aa-mods.vercel.app/ which hosts a privacy-focused WhatsApp mod called "AAWhatsApp". The site features a dark, high-tech, cyber-security aesthetic with neon accents.
​The Task:
I need to add a completely new product to this website called "AA Business WhatsApp". This requires a full set of pages (or a comprehensive single-page structure) that mirrors the exact design capability of the existing site but focuses on the Business version of the app.
​Design Language:
​Theme: Dark Mode, Cyber-security style (Keep the existing color palette but perhaps use a "Gold/Amber" or "Deep Blue" accent color to differentiate 'Business' from the standard app).
​Tone: Professional, "Hardened Security," "Zero-Trace," and High-Performance.
​Typography: Match existing fonts (clean sans-serif headers, readable body).
​Required Content & Structure:
​Create the code and content for the following sections/pages for AA Business WhatsApp:
​1. Hero Section (Top of Page)
​Headline: "AA Business WhatsApp – The Secure Fortress for Your Enterprise."
​Sub-headline: "Run your business on a ghost protocol. Client data secured. Zero-access architecture. Business tools unlocked."
​Call to Action: Two buttons: "Download AA Business v1.0" and "Join Telegram".
​Visual: A mock-up of the Business WhatsApp interface showing "Business Tools" with a shield icon.
​2. Key Features (The "Why Us" Section)
​Feature 1: Client Privacy Core. (Text: "Unlike standard WA Business, we strip tracking code. Your client lists and trade secrets never leave your device.")
​Feature 2: High-Volume Broadcasting. (Text: "Send bulk offers to unlimited clients without fear of bans. Our 'Warm-up' algorithm mimics human behavior.")
​Feature 3: Automated CRM. (Text: "Advanced auto-replies, catalog management, and quick labels—all offline and encrypted.")
​Feature 4: Anti-Ban Business Shield. (Text: "A specialized engine designed to protect high-activity business numbers from suspension.")
​3. "The Business Protocol" (Technical Specs)
​Create a section similar to the "System Protocol" on the main site.
​Status: "Business API: Decoupled."
​Encryption: "Commercial Grade 512-bit."
​Permission Status: "Clean (No Contact/Gallery Harvesting)."
​4. Comparison Table (AA Business vs. Official WA Business)
​Create a comparison table.
​Anti-Delete Messages: Yes (AA) vs No (Official).
​Broadcasting Limit: Unlimited (AA) vs 256 (Official).
​Catalog Limits: Uncapped (AA) vs Capped (Official).
​Data Harvesting: Zero (AA) vs High (Official).
​Theme Customization: Full (AA) vs None (Official).
​5. Download Section
​Provide distinct download boxes for "AA Business WhatsApp Package".
​Mirrors: "Fast Server (Primary)" and "MediaFire (Mirror)".
​Verification Badge: "Scanned: Safe for Corporate Use."
​6. FAQ Section (Business Specific)
​Q: Will I lose my current business chats? (A: No, our migration tool moves your chat database safely.)
​Q: Can I use this alongside the official WhatsApp? (A: Yes, the package name is distinct.)
​Q: Is it safe for sensitive client data? (A: Yes, we disabled the cloud analytics that standard WA uses.)
​Technical Requirements:
​Provide the HTML/React components (Next.js preferred).
​Use Tailwind CSS for styling to match the aa-mods repository.
​Ensure the "Download" buttons are prominent and use the same hover effects as the original site.
​Output:
Please generate the full code structure for this new page (e.g., /pages/aa-business-whatsapp.js) and the necessary components.
