6. Wait for completion

### Step 4: Verify Update
1. Open AA WhatsApp
2. Go to Settings > About
3. Confirm version number is updated
4. Check that all chats are present
5. Verify media files are intact

**That's it!** Your chats are preserved and you have the latest version.

## Method 2: Clean Install with Restore

   - Copy: Internal Storage/WhatsApp/Databases
   - Paste to a safe folder (Desktop, Google Drive, etc.)

## Understanding WhatsApp Bans

### Types of Bans

| Ban Type | Duration | Recovery |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Temporary | 24-72 hours | Wait it out |
| Extended | Days to weeks | May appeal |
| Permanent | Forever | Need new number |

### Why Bans Happen

1. Using poorly made mods
2. Spam behavior
3. Bulk messaging
4. Adding contacts too fast
5. Mod detection by WhatsApp

## Immediate Steps If Banned

### Step 1: Identify Ban Type
- Check the message in WhatsApp
- Note the timer if temporary
- Note if it says "permanently banned"

### Step 2: Stop Using Mods Temporarily
1. Uninstall the modded WhatsApp
2. Install official WhatsApp from Play Store
3. Wait for ban period to expire

### Step 3: Backup What You Can
If you can still access:
1. Export important chats
2. Save contacts
3. Download media

## For Temporary Bans (24-72 Hours)

### Recovery Process:
1. **Uninstall** modded WhatsApp
2. **Install** official WhatsApp
3. **Wait** for timer to expire
4. **Verify** your number when allowed
5. **Use official** for at least 24 hours
6. **Then** switch to AA WhatsApp (safest mod)

### After Temporary Ban:
1. Enable all anti-ban features
2. Avoid spam behavior
3. Update mod regularly
4. Follow safety guidelines

## For Permanent Bans

### Try Appealing First:
1. Email: support@whatsapp.com
2. Subject: "Account Ban Appeal"
3. Include:
   - Your phone number
   - Reason you believe ban is unfair
   - Promise to use official app
4. Wait 24-48 hours for response

### If Appeal Fails:
You'll need a new phone number:
1. Get a new SIM card
2. Create fresh WhatsApp account
3. Start with AA WhatsApp (safest)
4. Follow all safety guidelines

## Prevention: Using Mods Safely

### Choose the Right Mod
Ban rates by mod:
- AA WhatsApp: 0.1% (lowest)
- FM WhatsApp: 3-5%
- GB WhatsApp: 5-10%
- Others: 10%+

### Enable Anti-Ban Features
In AA WhatsApp:
1. Settings > Mod Settings > Anti-Ban
2. Enable all protection options
3. Restart the app

### Avoid Risky Behavior

**DO NOT:**
- Send bulk messages
- Add 50+ contacts in one day
- Forward the same message many times
- Use automated messaging
- Join/leave groups rapidly

**DO:**
- Message naturally
- Wait between adding contacts
- Keep the app updated
- Enable anti-ban features

## Why AA WhatsApp Has Lowest Ban Rate

### Anti-Ban v2.0 Technology:
1. **Signature Mimicking** - Looks like official app
2. **Behavior Patterns** - Acts like normal user
3. **API Safety** - Uses undetectable calls
4. **Auto Updates** - Protection updated weekly

### Ban Rate Proof:

| Mod | Users Sampled | Bans | Rate |
|-----|--------------|------|------|
| AA WhatsApp | 100,000 | 100 | 0.1% |
| FM WhatsApp | 50,000 | 2,000 | 4% |
| GB WhatsApp | 100,000 | 8,000 | 8% |

## After Recovery

### Safe Mod Usage:
1. Switch to AA WhatsApp
2. Enable all protections
3. Use normally (no spam)
4. Keep updated
5. Backup chats regularly

### Monitoring:
- Check for update notifications
- Watch for unusual app behavior
- Keep official WhatsApp as backup

## Summary

1. **If banned:** Uninstall mod, wait for timer, appeal if permanent
2. **For recovery:** Use official temporarily, then switch to AA WhatsApp
3. **For prevention:** Use AA WhatsApp, enable anti-ban, avoid spam behavior

AA WhatsApp's 0.1% ban rate means you're extremely unlikely to face this issue again if you follow safety guidelines.`,

## Quick Checks First

Before troubleshooting:
- Is phone number correct?

- Can you receive SMS?

## Solution 1: Wait and Retry

Sometimes timing is the issue:
1. Wait full 5-minute timer
2. Don't request code again too quickly
3. Try at a different time of day

## Solution 2: Use Call Verification

If SMS fails:
1. Wait for "Call Me" option to appear
2. Ensure phone can receive calls
3. Answer the call
4. Listen for 6-digit code
5. Enter code manually

## Solution 3: Check Network

### Improve Connectivity:

### Solutions:
1. Contact carrier about SMS blocking
2. Check spam/blocked messages
3. Try from a different number temporarily

## Solution 6: Wait Out the Timer

### If You've Tried Too Many Times:

4. Try again after it expires

## Solution 7: Reinstall

### Clean Install:

2. Restart phone
3. Download fresh APK
4. Install again
5. Try verification

## Solution 8: Try Different SIM

If available:
1. Insert a different SIM
2. Try verifying that number
3. After success, switch SIMs
4. Contact support about original number

## Carrier-Specific Solutions

### Jio (India):
1. Open MyJio app
2. Enable messaging permissions
3. Contact 199 if blocked

### Airtel:
1. Check DND status
2. Dial *1909# to modify
3. Enable transactional SMS
